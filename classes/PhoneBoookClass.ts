/**
 * By a phone book we mean

// The Data Structure to be used 

/** The Data Structure to used is an ARRAY
 * Reason
 * - Adding a contact to end of an array is constant time i.e O(1), 
 *  since it is not compulsory that we add to the start of the array which reindexes the whole array
 * - The Big O complexity in time to search for a particular contact is O(N) where N is the total number of contacts in the list
 *  If we know the index of the contact, then fetching the contact is O(1) 
 * - Fetching the whole list is also constant time 0(1) since there is just one operation perforned
 */

// Why arry won with respect with other data structures
/**
 * If it is mandatory that we should add to the beginning of the list, that means that an array is inefficient since the whole element will be reindexed. 
 * we can then consiter either a singly linked list or a doubly linked list whose addition to the start of the list is constant time.
 * Searching in array, singlyly linked list, and doubly linked list has big O time complexity of 0(N)
 * But accessing with a specific index will be O(1) with array and still 0(N) with both singly and doubly linked list.
